INTRODUCTION
In this project, I have built a React web application called Encore. I used my knowledge of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API and built a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

FEATURES
Below is a list of the website's features:

Spotify Login —  Whne user search for a first time , it will redirect to the log in page of Spotify. After log in you can search and add your songs. You can search for a song, album, or artist


Add Song to your Playlist — You can add a track to  playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.

Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.

Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.

Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.
